          Cutting is all about shedding body fat to reveal a lean and toned
          physique. While exercise is important for building muscle and boosting
          metabolism, it's not enough on its own to achieve a six-pack. That's
          where the cutting section of Alphaland comes in.

      <h2>THE CONCEPT OF <span>CALORIE DEFICIT</span></h2>
      <p>
        At Alphaland, we believe that achieving a calorie deficit is an
        essential part of any weight loss or cutting program. In simple terms, a
        calorie deficit means consuming fewer calories than your body burns each
        day.
        <br />
        <br />
        This creates an energy imbalance that forces your body to use stored fat
        as a source of fuel, leading to weight loss over time. However, it's
        important to achieve this deficit in a safe and sustainable way, to
        ensure that your body is still getting the nutrients it needs to support
        your overall health and well-being.
        <br />
        <br />
        By achieving a calorie deficit through a balanced and nutritious diet,
        you can achieve your weight loss or cutting goals while still feeling
        energized and satisfied.

              Knowing your maintenance calories is crucial for developing a
              nutrition plan that supports your fitness goals. Whether you're
              looking to lose weight, build muscle, or maintain your current
              physique, understanding your maintenance calories can help you
              determine the appropriate calorie deficit or surplus needed to
              achieve your goals.

            <p class="text-muted">
              Science behind cutting is pretty simple, eating less calories than
              you burn. Eat 200-300 cals less than your maintenance and burn
              more calories. This will force your body to burn the fat stored.

            <p class="text-muted">
              When starting your fitness journey, it's important to check your
              weight and assess your progress regularly. We recommend checking
              in after a week to see if you have made any progress. If you have
              not seen any changes in your weight, we suggest reducing your
              calorie intake by 100-200 calories or increasing your activity
              level to burn more calories.
